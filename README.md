# CG Practical Codes Repository

Welcome to the CG (Computer Graphics) Practical Codes Repository! üéâ

This repository contains C implementations of various computer graphics algorithms and techniques i did in 3rd Semester of my CS Degree. Whether you're a newbie learning computer graphics or a junior looking for reference implementations, you've come to the right place! üñ•Ô∏è

## Algorithms Implemented

### 2D Transformations
- **2DLineClip.cpp**: Implementation of 2D line clipping algorithm.
- **2DReflection.cpp**: Implementation of 2D reflection about different axes.
- **2DRotation.cpp**: Implementation of 2D rotation around a point.
- **2DScaling.cpp**: Implementation of 2D scaling transformation.
- **2Dtranslation.cpp**: Implementation of 2D translation transformation.

### 3D Transformations
- **3DTransformation.cpp**: Implementation of 3D transformations.
- **3dTranslation.cpp**: Implementation of 3D translation transformation.

### Line Drawing Algorithms
- **BLA.cpp**: Implementation of Bresenham's Line Drawing Algorithm.
- **DDA.cpp**: Implementation of Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA) Line Drawing Algorithm.

### Circle and Ellipse Drawing Algorithms
- **MidpointCircle.cpp**: Implementation of Midpoint Circle Drawing Algorithm.
- **MidpointEllipse.cpp**: Implementation of Midpoint Ellipse Drawing Algorithm.

## How to Use

Each `.cpp` file contains the implementation of a specific algorithm. To use any of these implementations, simply compile the respective file using a C++ compiler such as g++:
	`g++ 2DLineClip.cpp -o 2DLineClip && ./2DLineClip`

For Linux Systems, refer to the run.txt or simply, run: 
	`g++ -o ellip MidpointEllipse.cpp -lglut -lGLU -lGL && ./ellip `


Replace `2DLineClip.cpp` and `2DLineClip` with the name of the desired file and executable, respectively.

Feel free to explore the code, experiment with different parameters, and integrate these algorithms into your own projects! ‚ú®
